# Hangman in Java

## Requirements

- There is an array of strings containing list of words. Your program should read that array and randomly select one that is the target word(s) to guess.
- At the beginning program should represent each letter as a dash ("_") and display them on the screen. Additionally, program should show player's life points score (10).
- Program asks and waits for the user to enter letter or word. If entered letter doesn't exist in word or entered word is not correct - a messagge with an array with wrong letters will appear and the player will have 3 attemps before game over!
- If the player survives wrong letter guess - that letter is added to "not-in-word" list and be displayed at the screen.
- If the player guesses final letter or whole word(s) - he/she is the winner!
